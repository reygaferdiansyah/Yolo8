## Project Description

This project utilizes YOLO v8 for object detection on images containing toxic snail species. The integration of segmentation and data augmentation techniques from Roboflow is aimed at enhancing the quality and accuracy of detection. The project serves as a foundational framework for object detection applications focused on specific species.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/toxic-snail-object-detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the object detection script on images or videos:

    ```bash
    python object_detection.py --input input_image.jpg --output output_image.jpg
    ```

    Replace `input_image.jpg` with the input image file name and `output_image.jpg` with the output file name.

## Data Augmentation

This project leverages data augmentation from Roboflow to enrich the training dataset. To access the dataset and additional data augmentation, you can register at [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
